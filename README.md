# Phone holder for the keyboard (3D files)

This is a 3D design I made in order to attach my phone to the Apple Wireless Keyboard (though it may work with other keyboards, but I didn't test it).

in my case, I wanted to use the phone to execute macros on my MacBook (through a web app I am accessing from the phone), but you may use this holder for a different scenario.

The holder is actually divided into 2 parts, that can be be attached to they keyboard using a nut and a bolt for each part with a diameter of 3mm.
